    <p>My teacher once described the yoga journey by comparing it to a love affair.  At first you’re curious, interested in casually exploring what it has to offer.  Then you find yourself thinking about it more often, making greater commitments to it, and eventually realizing that like your loved one, it just becomes a part of who you are.  This is very much ow my own journey has unfolded.  Having always been active and fit, I’ve tried everything from team sports to fitness classes and running.  To me, exercise was something I did to de-stress and stay in shape.  Yoga was only part of the equation in a very minimal way as I attended occasional group classes to get a good stretch.  I always thought that I didn’t have the “right body type” for yoga; it was too slow-paced for me, and I was more suited to more cardio-focused activities.</p>

    <p>In the fall of 2012, I found myself feeling over-trained and stressed, with hormones out of balance even though I was at my lowest weight since becoming a mother.  I looked good on the outside, but inside things had gone awry.  The yoga classes that I attended only occasionally started to become part of my regular routine as I sought out something different.  I enjoyed the peaceful feeling it brought to my mind and body.  The twice-weekly classes weren’t enough, so as I yearned for more, I started meeting with my teacher privately and later joined Guided Self Practice (GSP), starting my mornings off with a solid practice of moving breath meditation.  When the opportunity presented itself for me to pursue teacher training, I committed whole-heartedly and was captivated as immersed myself in learning all that I could from my teachers and peers. I am now certified RYT-200 in Vinyasa Yoga plus as an additional 100 hours of training for Yoga Wellness Coaching and Adamantine® Yoga with Master Teacher James Miller. Adamantine® has been a gift - a wonderful approach to yoga aimed at balancing our modern bodies within the framework of ancient tradition.</p>

    <p>Yoga derives its name from the Sanskrit root yuj - to yoke, to join, or to unite. It is the practice of aligning your body, mind, and spirit in union in order to experience your whole self and be fully present. This is what yoga has been for me - a way to connect to my inner self, to be fully present in my mind and body, and to seek the very best version of myself possible on the path to wellness.  I have truly been transformed by this practice and am passionate about sharing it with my students.  Whether you are just curious about what yoga is and how it could fit into your lifestyle, or if you are already a dedicated practitioner looking for a teacher, I would be honored to be a part of your journey.</p>

    <p>Namaste</p>
