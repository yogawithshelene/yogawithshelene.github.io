    <p><strong>What is it?</strong> Adamantine® Yoga is a spiritual discipline that offers a simple and empowering means of discovering the heroic qualities within each of us.  Adamantine® Yoga integrates three distinct facets of yoga into a cohesive and transformative daily practice. Posture, Breath, and Concentration combine to form a moving meditation built around a framework of 20 yogic positions.</p>

    <p>As this practice takes root in your consciousness, your daily Actions naturally align with the spiritual truths revealed, allowing you to live with integrity and authenticity.</p>

    <p><strong>What does the word adamantine mean?</strong> Adamantine means having the hardness or luster of a diamond.  Diamonds have long been used as a metaphor for the perfection of the human body.  The diamond body or adamantine body is a yogic ideal used to describe the end product of intentionally refining your physical body as a means of developing your whole self.</p>

    <p><strong>What are the benefits of practicing Adamantine® Yoga?</strong> Through the practice of Adamantine® Yoga you will create for yourself a stronger, leaner, more flexible and coordinated physical body. </p>

    <p>As you become more refined physically your skills of concentration will also improve and your mind will become steady and capable of single-pointed focus.</p>

    <p>By encountering the physical and mental challenges of this discipline your true spirit will be revealed, and you will have the opportunity to choose new ways of approaching adversity.  The heroic qualities of Integrity, Nonviolence, Surrender and Gratitude will become your natural response to challenge, and you will find you navigate life with greater grace and ease.</p>
