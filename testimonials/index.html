    <p>Yoga is the perfect recovery option for me because it keeps me accountable to stretch and work on my weak areas. Shelene is able to recognize those weaknesses and work with me so I can get to a place that is challenging enough to progress. She is very relatable and non judgmental. I would recommend her to any one of my clients.</p><b>Pat Smith, Personal Trainer, Altoona</b>

Never gimmicky, Shelene’s gentle guidance has encouraged me to pay more attention to the imbalances I unwittingly impose on myself, helping me to overcome them through better awareness for better overall well-being.</p><b>Carrie Forristall, Altoona</b>

    <p>Shelene assumed the responsibility of continuing on with a successful, existing practice with very little transition time.   She did so with exceptional grace, dedication, and hard work.  She instills pride, motivation, and accomplishment in each of her students while always being available to respond to individual requests for assistance.  She is a credit to her practice and I am fortunate to be one of her students.</p><b>Ray Sears, Pleasant Hill</b>
