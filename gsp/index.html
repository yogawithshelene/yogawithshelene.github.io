    <p>Guided Self Practice offers the opportunity for you to move through your personal practice of Adamantine速 Yoga within the support and community of a group setting.</p>

    <p>You will be moving through the Adamantine速Yoga sequence at your own pace with modifications and adaptations that uniquely fit your experience level and ability.</p>

    <p>Adamantine速 Yoga teacher Shelene Billups personally supervises Guided Self Practice and assists each student individually with verbal instructions and physical adjustments.</p>

    <p>Guided Self Practice is the ideal setting for your daily practice of Adamantine速 Yoga. It provides the unique opportunity to refine your yoga skills with the direct personal supervision of a teacher, and allows for you to receive the support and encouragement you need to thrive.</p>
